# forecaster
i had a idp project where i have to develop a weather monitoring gui + weather forecaster 
one cons is it has been developed for mobile screen size only very soon or may be in jan or feb 2023 i ll make it adaptable for desktop and tab screen size,and will improve the gui
,till now no front end framework or any css utility framework have been used, all gui customization has been done with plain css and js,
one more thing is it has all the important keys are openly hardcoded which not safe,i ll improve this one in future,i have done this project in hurry i ll make it organized and secure.
in upcoming update.
